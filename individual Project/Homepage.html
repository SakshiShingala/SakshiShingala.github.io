			<h2>Customer Feedback and Reviews</h2>
			
			<p>Joelle Siemers is truely exceptional. She was ALWAYS available for home tours. Their 
			responsiveness was incredible. If they didn’t pick up, they always call back no longer than 
			5 minutes later. Seriously. I purchased a newly constructed condo so it wasn’t a straightforward 
			deal. They told me that going in and highlighted the concerns they had and the research they
			wanted to do to make sure progress was being made and I wouldn’t have to wait for a long time 
			to move in. (March 25,2023)</p>

			<p>Joelle Siemers was immensely patient with our seemingly endless questions. She asked questions
			on our behalf that we didn’t think of to make sure the home we were touring didn’t have hidden 
			issues or was updated to code by licensed individuals/companies. Once we got into escrow, 
			Siemers was diligent in making sure all inspections were in place, communicated with the 
			seller’s agent, and kept us informed on a daily basis. (January 15, 2023)</p>

			<p>Joelle Siemers will work with you to make your desires a reality. She is also very well versed
			at dealing with other real estate agents. When there were disagreements about certain verbiage 
			in documents, Siemers was patient and worked through some tough situations without breaking a 
			sweat. Their cool, calm mindset kept my anxiety low and gave me the confidence they would get 
			the job done – and they did! (December 22, 2023)</p>
